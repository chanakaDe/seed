# CSS tricks

Since Seed is browser based, we can use a lot of CSS functionality. Below are a few examples on using things like **flex, grid or animate and fontawesome**:

In the examples section is a fairly simple example of [Flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) in CSS. The example pulls a number of pictures from cats and shows them in a flexible layout. The trick is in referring to style in the container div structure like this:  `style="display: flex; flex-wrap:wrap;"`

an example on [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) works in a similar way. The grid creates a layout on which a system of rotated [truchet tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles) is placed.

Seed also allows to use CSS from somewhere else. To increase animation options  we can use a range of predefined animations and import them over a link tag. [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) is an example of such a stylesheet. We can point to a version hosted on a cdn ([content delivery network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)) like this:

A similar example on using external CSS: use [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/) css. Again we can point to a version on a cdn:
