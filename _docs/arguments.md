# Working with arguments

Lets's have a look at a simple animation of a group of circles falling to the ground. We can have a few copies of them:
<iframe src="/embed/-L5VCttyxpWl5t8VjzwW"></iframe>

Suppose we want to add a specific css style called animation-delay to break the synchonicity of the example. We could refer to it by using a range. Which will result in a random nummer for each circle.
<iframe src="/embed/-L5VD42AIUaMUGP0CMit"></iframe>

We can also send an argument and use that to obtain an animation-delay for each group of circles.

With a little more additions we can recreate something like the matrix rain effect (in red):
